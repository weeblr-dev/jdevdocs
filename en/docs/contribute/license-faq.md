The Joomla! developer documentation contains collaborative community-contributed documentation for the Joomla! project aimed at core and extensions developers.

## Introduction to the Joomla! Electronic Documentation License

The intention of the Joomla! EDL is to foster wide electronic distribution of Joomla! documentation while ensuring that any additions or modifications to it can, at our discretion, be taken up and made part of the authoritative documentation distributed by the Joomla! project. In this way we hope to ensure that more people can benefit from the work of the authors and improvements made to the documentation can be brought back into the project for the benefit of all. We want to encourage use of the documentation, including commercial use, but at the same time we want to make sure that the documentation cannot be made proprietary.

All new documentation produced by the Joomla! project will be subject to the Joomla! EDL unless otherwise noted. We will attempt to bring earlier documentation under this license too, but this requires that we obtain permission from all the copyright holders. Please ensure that you check the license for each individual piece of documentation before attempting to distribute it. If you have any questions relating to this license please send an email to license@opensourcematters.org.

Please note this FAQ is not part of the license but is merely provided to help you understand how the license works.
